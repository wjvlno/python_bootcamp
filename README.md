# Python Bootcamp Pre-Bootcamp Tasks

Welcome to the Summer 2024 Python Bootcamp! Before the first session, please complete the following tasks to ensure you're set up and ready to go. This includes installing Anaconda and getting familiar with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Step 1: Download and Install Anaconda

Anaconda is a free and open-source Python distribution that comes pre-loaded with packages for scientific computing. It's like a 'batteries-included' version of Python.

1. **Download the Anaconda Installer**:
   - **MacOS**: [Anaconda Installation Guide for MacOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/mac-os/)
   - **Windows**: [Anaconda Installation Guide for Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/)

2. **Install Anaconda**:
   - Follow the instructions provided in the installation guides linked above.

## Step 2: Open Anaconda Navigator and Launch a Jupyter Notebook

Once Anaconda is installed, you can open Anaconda Navigator, which is an interface for launching Python-related applications and handling Python packages.

1. **Open Anaconda Navigator**:
   - Find and open Anaconda Navigator from your Applications folder (MacOS) or Start menu (Windows).

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - In Anaconda Navigator, click on the Jupyter Notebook icon to launch it. This should open a new tab in your internet browser.
   - In the Jupyter Notebook interface, create a new 'Python 3' notebook.

3. **Run a Python Script**:
   - In the new notebook, type the following Python script and execute it by pressing the Run button or using `Ctrl+Enter` on your keyboard:
     ```python
     heart_emoji = "\u2764\uFE0F"  # Unicode for red heart emoji
     print(f"I don't like snakes, but I {heart_emoji} Python!")  # Display message with heart emoji
     ```
